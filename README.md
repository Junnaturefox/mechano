Using Mechano to its fullest potential would involve lots of big changes to other mods that many may feel to be intrusive to their experience. This is why Mechano's more intrusive features (e.g. disabling blocks) will be tweakable via config. If you're interested in using Mechano *exactly* the way you want, I'd suggest you look into KubeJS.
