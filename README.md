# mechano

## This Minecraft mod is designed as a way to provide overhauls or stand-in replacements for various features of other tech mods, ultimately to improve consistancy, immersion, and to significantly increase the playtime of modpacks.

This mod plans to:
- [ ] Add connectors, wires, and batteries that offer transfer rates comparable to other mods <br />
- [ ] Relays, Breakers, and other immersive wiring components that use SU to function <br />
- [ ] Add multiblock equivalent structures to many of Create Crafts & Additions blocks <br />
- [ ] Generative toolset suite for TiC-style toolmaking, but with SU-based stuff <br />
- [ ] Add new recipe triggers based on in-world events (lightning strikes, "ritual-style" stuff, etc) <br />
- [ ] Bring back buildcraft's assembly table in Create's style <br />
- [ ] A full pass over AE2, replacing drive bays with reel-to-reel tapes that require Create's SU to run <br />
- [ ] In-depth recipe changes to supporting mods to accomodate aforementioned stuff <br />

Using Mechano to its fullest potential would involve lots of big changes to other mods that many may feel to be intrusive to their experience. This is why Mechano's more intrusive features (e.g. disabling blocks) will be tweakable via config. If you're interested in using Mechano *exactly* the way you want, I'd suggest you look into KubeJS.
